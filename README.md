# ML-Classification-Project
This project is based on the San Franscisco Crime Classification competition that was hosted on Kaggle in 2014.

This project also has its Flask app which clasifies the data from the model trained in that application.

Train and Test Data are available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime
